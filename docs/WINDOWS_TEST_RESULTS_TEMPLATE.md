# Windows candidate test record

Fill this out while running the current Windows candidate. Replace each `TBD` with the observed result; write `not tested` when a check cannot be run. Keep failures and limitations visible.

The native capture service passes its Windows integration suite in [hosted run 38026224608](https://github.com/kris70lesgo/frame-studio/actions/runs/38026224608). This record is for the separate interactive app, desktop, and screenshot checks.
